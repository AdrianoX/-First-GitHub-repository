    <h1>Pouring the winde</h1>
        <p>Unknown creator</p><br>
    <h3>A ward is an adventure<br>
        A touch is a written thought<br>
        A sight like wry mirror of the sun<br>
        It may be broken<br>
        Like a crystal glass on the prince's head<br>
        Noble past dominates<br>
        in genetics of events<br>
        Harsh like from not cut pages<br>
        Reading the blind's poem<br><br>
        
        Colours describing won't be his attribute<br>
        The result will prove faulty<br>
        Because the matter didn't get the pain<br>
        And mixing wine with blood<br>
        She forgot about glasses<br>
    </h3>
